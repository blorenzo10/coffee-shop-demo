# Requests
I want to provide as much value as I possibly can to the iOS developers who are starting their journey (and to more advanced devs as well). So, If you've something in mind that could be added to the project, please submit a new request from the `Issues` tab

I'll try my best to do it and to make a new article with the details 🤓
